			<p class="lead">Adobe has built a monopoly on creativity. They use their "Creative Cloud" to lock professionals into an endless cycle of monthly payments and data harvesting. But in 2026, the tools for professional video, graphics, and audio have matured beyond the need for Adobe. Tebian is the new home for the **Adobe Refugee.**</p>

			<h2>1. The End of Subscription Sovereignty</h2>
			<p>When you use Adobe tools, you don't own your tools; you rent them. If you stop paying, you lose access to your own work files. This is a fundamental violation of creative sovereignty. Tebian prioritizes <strong>Ownable Software</strong>—tools that you can install, keep, and use forever without a corporate leash.</p>
			
			<p>We use our <strong>C-level foundation</strong> to ensure these creative tools have direct access to your hardware (GPU/CPU), resulting in render times that are faster than Windows or macOS.</p>

			<h2>2. The Replacement Stack</h2>
			<p>Moving away from Adobe isn't about "making do" with lesser tools. It is about switching to professional-grade engines that respect your freedom.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Photoshop → GIMP / Krita:</strong> GIMP provides the raw pixel-manipulation power, while Krita provides a world-class painting and illustration engine that beats Photoshop in brush performance.</li>
				<li><strong>Premiere → DaVinci Resolve:</strong> resolve is the industry standard for Hollywood color grading and editing. It runs natively on Tebian with full NVIDIA/AMD GPU acceleration.</li>
				<li><strong>After Effects → Blender:</strong> Blender's 3D and compositing engine is the most advanced open-source project in the world. It replaces After Effects for motion graphics and VFX.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3. The Performance Edge</h2>
			<p>Adobe apps are famously bloated. They carry legacy code and telemetry that slows down your renders. Native Tebian tools are <strong>Lean.</strong> By using a C-based OS core and hardware-native drivers, you get 100% of your GPU's power dedicated to your art. No background updaters "checking for licensing" in the middle of a render.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion: Reclaiming your Art</h2>
			<p>The Adobe Refugee is someone who chooses <strong>Craft over Convenience.</strong> By learning the sovereign creative stack on Tebian, you are investing in skills that belong to you, not to a subscription service. One ISO. One menu. Total creative independence. Welcome home.</p>
