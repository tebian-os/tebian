			<h1>The Myth of Modern Security</h1>

		<article class="content">
			<p class="lead">Most people believe that a secure operating system is one with many features: antivirus, firewalls, biometric login, and "AI-powered" threat detection. They are wrong. Security is not a list of features; it is a lack of surface area.</p>

			<h2>The Surface Area Problem</h2>
			<p>In cybersecurity, "Attack Surface" refers to the total number of points (the "vectors") where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Every line of code, every background service, and every open port is part of your attack surface.</p>
			
			<p>Windows 11 has roughly 50 million lines of code. It runs hundreds of background services. It has a complex registry, a legacy "Win32" subsystem, and a massive telemetry engine. This is a <strong>Continental Attack Surface.</strong> Even with the best antivirus in the world, there are simply too many doors to lock.</p>

			<h2>Minimalism as Defense</h2>
			<p>Tebian's "Core 3" (Sway, Fuzzel, Mako) represents a radical reduction in attack surface. By stripping away the Desktop Environment and relying on a minimal, C-based compositor, we've reduced the doors from a thousand to a dozen.</p>
			
			<p>When you run Tebian, there is no "Print Spooler" running in the background waiting for a buffer overflow. There is no "Cortana" listening to your mic. There is no "Remote Registry" service. If the code isn't there, it cannot be exploited. This is the **C-Level Security** fundamental: The most secure code is the code that doesn't exist.</p>

			<h2>The Debian Hardening</h2>
			<p>We build on <strong>Debian Stable</strong> because it is the most audited operating system in existence. The Debian Security Team doesn't just "fix bugs"; they provide a stable, predictable base that allows us to apply Mandatory Access Control (AppArmor) and secure kernel parameters (Sysctl) without fear of breaking the system.</p>

			<h2>Privacy is Security</h2>
			<p>A "Secure" OS that sends your data to a corporate cloud is a contradiction. Telemetry is a security hole. If your OS is sending "Usage Data" to a server, that data can be intercepted, subpoenaed, or leaked. Tebian's <strong>Zero Telemetry</strong> policy isn't just about privacy; it's about closing the most dangerous outbound door in your system.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion: The Fortress of Silence</h2>
			<p>True security isn't loud. It doesn't give you pop-ups telling you it's "Protecting your PC." True security is a silent, minimal system that does exactly what you ask and nothing more. Tebian is that fortress. One ISO. One menu. Zero compromises.</p>
