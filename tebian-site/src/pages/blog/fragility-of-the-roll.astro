			<h1>The Fragility of the Roll: Why Arch Linux is a Part-Time Job</h1>

			<p class="lead">In the ricing community, Arch Linux is the "God-Tier" distro. It represents the "Bleeding Edge" of software. But for the professional user who needs their machine to work <em>now</em>, Arch is a liability. The "Rolling Release" model is a construction site where the foundation is always moving. Tebian chooses the **Rock of Debian Stable.**</p>

			<h2>1. The Myth of the "Bleeding Edge"</h2>
			<p>Arch users believe that having the latest version of a package <em>today</em> is superior to having a version that works <em>tomorrow</em>. But let's look at the technical reality. When a core library like <code>glibc</code> or <code>openssl</code> updates in Arch, it changes the symbols that other programs expect to find. In a rolling release, these shifts happen every week. Your system is in a state of constant transition.</p>
			
			<p>Tebian's foundation, <strong>Debian Stable</strong>, updates its foundation once every two years. Security patches flow like water, but the ABI (Application Binary Interface) is carved in stone. This is why Tebian servers run for 1,000 days without a reboot, while Arch systems frequently panic after a simple <code>pacman -Syu</code>.</p>

			<h2>2. The "Wiki as a Crutch" Problem</h2>
			<p>The Arch Wiki is incredible. It is perhaps the best documentation in the Linux world. But <em>why</em> is it so good? Because Arch is so complex and moves so fast that you <strong>need</strong> a 5,000-word article just to install a bootloader. Arch users spend more time reading the wiki than using their OS.</p>
			
			<p>Tebian's philosophy is <strong>Transparency Over Magic.</strong> We provide a working system out of the box (Sway + Fuzzel). We don't hide our scripts or our configs—they are all in <code>~/Tebian/</code> for you to audit. But we don't ask you to spend your Saturday morning fixing a broken PipeWire update. We've done the C-level engineering so you can do your work.</p>

			<h2>3. The AUR Trap</h2>
			<p>The **Arch User Repository (AUR)** is often cited as the reason to use Arch. It has "everything." In reality, the AUR is a collection of user-submitted scripts that download and compile software. It is a security nightmare and a stability landmine. Many AUR packages are abandoned or conflict with system libraries during a "Roll."</p>
			
			<p>Tebian provides **AUR access without the Arch fragility.** Through <strong>Distrobox</strong>, we allow you to run an Arch container inside Tebian. You get access to the AUR for that <em>one specific tool</em> you need, but it is isolated from your host OS. If the AUR package breaks, it only breaks the container, not your workstation. This is "Sovereign Engineering."</p>

			<h2>Conclusion: A Tool, Not a Project</h2>
			<p>Arch Linux is a project. It's a hobby. It's a great way to learn how Linux works. But Tebian is a <strong>Tool.</strong> It is designed for the person who has already learned how Linux works and now needs to use it to build things. We take the speed of Arch (via our C-based core) and combine it with the reliability of Debian. One ISO. One menu. No part-time maintenance required.</p>
