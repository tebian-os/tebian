			<h1>Local Intelligence: Why Your AI Should Be a Binary</h1>
			<p class="meta">February 20, 2026 • 18 min read</p>

		<article class="content">
			<p class="lead">AI has become a buzzword for surveillance. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are built on a "Cloud-First" model that harvests your data to improve their models. Tebian's answer is <strong>Local Intelligence</strong>—AI that lives as a binary on your hardware, not a service in their cloud.</p>

			<h2>The GPU Gold Rush</h2>
			<p>In 2026, the hardware in your "Gaming Rig" or "Creative Workstation" is a powerhouse. Most users only push their GPUs to the limit during a match or a render. The rest of the time, those CUDA cores and Tensor cores are idle. We believe that your hardware should be working for you at all times. This is where <strong>Ollama</strong> comes in.</p>
			
			<p>Ollama is a high-performance, C-based runner for Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows you to run Llama 3, Mistral, and Phi-3 directly on your GPU. It doesn't need an internet connection. It doesn't need an API key. It is a binary that talks to your silicon.</p>

			<h2>Privacy as a Service</h2>
			<p>When you ask a cloud AI a question, that question is stored, analyzed, and used to train future models. If you are a developer pasting proprietary code or a professional discussing sensitive strategy, this is a massive risk. Local AI eliminates that risk. <strong>Your prompts never leave your machine.</strong></p>
			
			<p>You can feed your local AI your own documents, your own codebases, and your own private data without fear of leakage. It's the ultimate "Private Brain."</p>

			<h2>The "C-Level" Performance Metric</h2>
			<p>Why is Ollama better than a web interface? <strong>Latency and Context.</strong> In Tebian, we've integrated our <code>t-ask</code> CLI tool. You can pipe a file directly into an LLM from your terminal: <code>cat main.c | t-ask "Explain this code"</code>. There is no network overhead. No waiting for a "Processing..." indicator from a distant server. It is as fast as your RAM can move data to your VRAM.</p>

			<h2>AI as a System Utility</h2>
			<p>We don't see AI as a "Product." We see it as a **System Utility**, like <code>grep</code> or <code>sed</code>. It's a tool for transforming and understanding data. By making AI local, we make it part of your OS. It's just another binary in <code>/usr/bin</code>.</p>
			
			<p>You can automate your workflows, summarize your system logs, and generate boilerplates—all without ever touching the internet. It is the definition of digital independence.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion: Reclaiming Intelligence</h2>
			<p>The "Cloud AI" era is the end of privacy. The "Local AI" era is the rebirth of productivity. Tebian provides the foundation to run the world's most advanced intelligence on your own terms. Your brain. Your silicon. Your Tebian.</p>
