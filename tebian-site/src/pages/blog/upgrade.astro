			<p class="lead">Most people think a "faster computer" requires a credit card. They are wrong. Most computers aren't slow because of their hardware; they are slow because they are being choked by their own operating system.</p>

			<h2>The Thief in the Background</h2>
			<p>Windows and macOS are built on a philosophy of "More." More telemetry, more indexing, more transparency effects, and more background services. Every one of these is a thief. They steal CPU cycles and RAM that should belong to <strong>you</strong>.</p>
			
			<p>When you use Tebian, you are performing a software "engine swap." We replace a bloated, V8-sized operating system with a lightweight, high-performance C-based core.</p>

			<h2>The C-Level Difference</h2>
			<p>At Tebian, we go deep. We don't use desktop environments written in JavaScript or Python. Our core stack—<strong>Sway, Fuzzel, and Mako</strong>—is written in C. Why does this matter to a grandma or a gamer?</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>No Runtime:</strong> Unlike modern apps, C binaries don't need a "virtual machine" to run. They talk directly to the hardware.</li>
				<li><strong>Instant Execution:</strong> When you press a key, the action happens in microseconds, not milliseconds.</li>
				<li><strong>Zero Idle:</strong> On a fresh boot, Tebian uses roughly 16MB of RAM. A modern Windows install uses 2,000MB (2GB) just to show you the desktop.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The "One Menu" Experience</h2>
			<p>We've eliminated the "Start Menu" paralysis. In Tebian, there is only one menu. You press <code>Super + D</code> and a simple list appears. You type "Browser," "Steam," or "Settings," and it opens. Almost instantly.</p>
			
			<p>This simplicity is what makes it "Grandma-Proof." There are no pop-ups asking to update your cloud storage. There are no hidden settings menus. There is just you and your work.</p>

			<h2>How to Upgrade Today</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Download:</strong> Grab the Tebian ISO (under 1GB).</li>
				<li><strong>Flash:</strong> Put it on a USB stick.</li>
				<li><strong>Boot:</strong> Plug it into any computer—PC, Mac, or even a Raspberry Pi.</li>
				<li><strong>Decide:</strong> "Desktop? Y/n."</li>
			</ol>

			<p>In ten minutes, that 5-year-old laptop will feel faster than a brand-new machine from the store. That is the power of the Universal Foundation.</p>
