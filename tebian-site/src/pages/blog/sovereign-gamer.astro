			<p class="lead">The Steam Deck (SteamOS) proved to the world that Linux is the ultimate gaming platform. But you don't need a handheld to experience that power. Tebian brings the SteamOS philosophy to your desktop—with none of the bloat.</p>

			<h2>The SteamOS Revolution</h2>
			<p>Valve did something radical: they took <strong>Arch Linux</strong>, stripped away the fluff, and built a minimal "Gamescope" session on top of it. They proved that a dedicated, lightweight Linux base could run Windows games (via Proton) with near-native performance. They didn't try to build a "Windows clone." They built a "Console OS."</p>
			
			<p>Tebian takes this one step further. We don't use the rolling, fragile Arch base of SteamOS. We use <strong>Debian Stable</strong>. We want the Steam Deck experience—one that "just works"—on every PC, Mac, and laptop.</p>

			<h2>The FPS Gains of Minimalism</h2>
			<p>Why is Linux gaming faster? It’s not magic; it’s <strong>Resource Recovery</strong>. In Windows 11, background tasks (telemetry, indexing, cloud sync) consume roughly 20-30% of your CPU's "interrupt budget." Every time your OS "checks for updates" in the middle of a match, your frame-times spike. This is the cause of "micro-stutter."</p>
			
			<p>In Tebian, there are no background tasks. Your CPU is 100% dedicated to the game. When you run a game via <strong>GameMode</strong> on Tebian, we lock your CPU governor to <code>performance</code>, grant the game <code>realtime</code> priority, and suspend all non-essential threads. The result? A smoother, higher-FPS experience than Windows.</p>

			<h2>The Proton Edge</h2>
			<p>Through <strong>Proton</strong> (Valve's fork of Wine), Tebian can run 90%+ of the top Steam games. We use a C-based <strong>Vulkan</strong> translation layer (DXVK) to convert DirectX calls into Vulkan calls in real-time. On modern GPUs, this overhead is often lower than the overhead of Windows' own DirectX implementation.</p>

			<h2>The "Sovereign" Choice</h2>
			<p>Being a "Sovereign Gamer" means you aren't tied to a single platform. Tebian includes one-click installers for <strong>Heroic</strong> (Epic/GOG), <strong>Lutris</strong> (All launchers), and <strong>EmulationStation</strong> (Retro games). We don't care where you bought your games. We only care that they run at full speed.</p>
			
			<p>And for the games that absolutely <em>must</em> have Windows (Valorant, Destiny 2), Tebian provides a safe, guided <strong>Dual-boot</strong> setup. You aren't "switching" to Linux; you are "graduating" to a better base, while keeping Windows in a sandbox for the anti-cheat titles.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion: The Console Desktop</h2>
			<p>The Sovereign Gamer is the future. You want a desktop that acts like a console—fast, stable, and invisible—but has the power of a workstation. That is Tebian. One ISO. One menu. All your games.</p>
