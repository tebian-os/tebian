			<h1>The Windows Exodus: Why 2026 is the Year to Leave Redmond</h1>

			<p class="lead">For three decades, Windows has been the default answer to the question "How do I use a computer?" But in 2026, that answer has become a liability. Windows 11 is no longer an operating system; it is a data-harvesting platform that happens to run apps. It is time for the Exodus.</p>

			<h2>1. The Monetization of the Desktop</h2>
			<p>If you use Windows 11 today, you aren't the customer; you are the inventory. Every update brings new "features" that the user never asked for: Start Menu advertisements, "suggested" apps in the taskbar, and constant nudges to use Edge and OneDrive. Microsoft has transformed the desktop from a tool into a billboard.</p>
			
			<p>In Tebian, the desktop is a sacred space. We follow the <strong>Law of Zero</strong>: Zero ads, zero telemetry, zero friction. When you look at your screen on Tebian, you see your work, not Microsoft's quarterly revenue targets. This isn't just a matter of "annoyance"; it is a fundamental violation of the relationship between a human and their tool.</p>

			<h2>2. The Technical Debt of Legacy Bloat</h2>
			<p>Windows is a victim of its own success. To maintain compatibility with software from 1995, it carries a staggering amount of technical debt. The "Win32" subsystem, the Registry, the legacy Control Panel—these are all layers of abstraction that consume CPU cycles and introduce security vulnerabilities. This is why Windows requires a minimum of 8GB of RAM just to feel "fast."</p>
			
			<p>Tebian, built on <strong>C-level fundamentals</strong>, rejects this bloat. We don't carry legacy baggage. Our core compositor, Sway, is written in modern C and talks directly to the Wayland protocol. This is why Tebian can run a full professional desktop in 16MB of RAM. While Windows is busy managing its own complexity, Tebian is busy managing your tasks.</p>

			<h2>3. The Telemetry Tax</h2>
			<p>One of the most significant performance killers in Windows 11 is the background telemetry engine. At any given moment, your CPU is being interrupted by "Experience Host" processes, "Compatibility Telemetry" scanners, and "Usage Reporters." These tasks steal from your "Interrupt Budget"—the tiny slices of time your CPU uses to respond to your mouse and keyboard.</p>
			
			<p>This is the technical reason Windows feels "heavy" compared to Tebian. Even on a $3,000 gaming PC, Windows introduces <strong>Jitter</strong>. Tebian is silent. There are no background reporters. When you press a key, the CPU is 100% available to respond. This results in an input latency that is objectively lower than Windows.</p>

			<h2>4. The Planned Obsolescence of TPM 2.0</h2>
			<p>Microsoft's decision to require TPM 2.0 and specific CPU generations for Windows 11 was a death sentence for millions of perfectly functional computers. This wasn't a technical requirement; it was a market-moving strategy. It created a mountain of E-waste and forced users into a hardware upgrade cycle they didn't need.</p>
			
			<p>Tebian is the <strong>Lazarus Engine.</strong> We don't care if your CPU was made in 2012 or 2026. If it speaks the x86_64 or Arm64 instruction set, Tebian will run on it with maximum efficiency. We believe that hardware belongs to the owner, not the software vendor. By switching to Tebian, you are extending the life of your hardware by a decade.</p>

			<h2>5. Security through Minimalism vs. Complexity</h2>
			<p>Windows attempts to solve security with more software: Windows Defender, SmartScreen, and "AI-powered" threat detection. But as we've detailed in the <em>Myth of Security</em>, adding code only adds attack surface. Every new security "feature" in Windows is a new potential exploit vector.</p>
			
			<p>Tebian's security model is <strong>Architectural.</strong> We don't have a "Defender" because we don't have the background services that need defending. We run a minimal set of C-binaries, a hardened kernel, and a default-deny firewall. To an attacker, a Windows machine is a mansion with 500 windows; a Tebian machine is a steel box with one locked door.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion: Reclaiming the Command</h2>
			<p>Leaving Windows isn't just about "using Linux." It is about reclaiming your role as the <strong>Root</strong> of your own machine. It is about choosing a tool that respects your focus, your privacy, and your hardware. The Windows Exodus isn't a trend; it's a return to sanity. One ISO. One menu. Total freedom.</p>
