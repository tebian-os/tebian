			<h1>The Snap Trap: Why Ubuntu Lost Its Way</h1>

		<article class="content">
			<p class="lead">Ubuntu was once the "Linux for Human Beings." It took the stability of Debian and added a layer of user-friendliness that brought millions to the open-source world. But in 2026, Ubuntu has become a corporate experiment in centralized control. The "Snap Trap" is the reason Tebian goes straight to the source.</p>

			<h2>1. The Problem with Centralization</h2>
			<p>Ubuntu's "Snap" package format is marketed as a way to provide always-up-to-date software. In reality, it is a proprietary back-end controlled entirely by Canonical. Unlike standard Linux repositories (like Debian's <code>apt</code>), you cannot host your own Snap store. This is a betrayal of the <strong>Decentralized Philosophy</strong> of Linux.</p>
			
			<p>In Tebian, we use <code>apt</code> for our core foundation. We believe that repositories should be open, mirrorable, and controlled by the community, not a single corporation. By choosing Debian as our base, we ensure that Tebian can never be "locked in" to a single company's infrastructure.</p>

			<h2>2. The Performance Penalty of Loopback Mounts</h2>
			<p>Snaps are containerized applications. When you boot Ubuntu, the OS has to mount a "loopback device" for every single Snap you have installed. Run <code>lsblk</code> on a fresh Ubuntu install and you will see a list of <code>/dev/loop</code> devices that clutters your system. This isn't just an aesthetic issue; it is a performance hit.</p>
			
			<p>Each loopback mount adds overhead to the kernel's filesystem layer. It increases boot time and consumes RAM. Tebian's C-based tools (Sway, Fuzzel) are installed as native <code>.deb</code> packages. They don't need containers. They don't need loopback devices. They are part of the system, not a layer on top of it. This is why Tebian boots in seconds while Ubuntu struggles.</p>

			<h2>3. The "Silent Update" War</h2>
			<p>Snaps are designed to update automatically in the background. Canonical believes that the user is too incompetent to manage their own updates. This results in apps closing unexpectedly or behaving differently without warning. It is the "Windows Update" philosophy brought to Linux.</p>
			
			<p>Tebian respects your intelligence. We follow the <strong>Law of Zero Friction</strong>: Nothing happens on your machine without your command. When you run <code>update-all</code>, you see exactly what is being updated and why. You own the update cycle. You are the Root.</p>

			<h2>4. The "Fake" Apt Packages</h2>
			<p>Perhaps the most deceptive move by Ubuntu was the "Snap Hijack." When you run <code>sudo apt install chromium-browser</code> on Ubuntu, the system doesn't install a <code>.deb</code> package. It silently installs the Snap version. This is a violation of the user's explicit command.</p>
			
			<p>Tebian provides a 100% <strong>Transparent Stack.</strong> When you ask for a package, you get that package. We don't use wrapper scripts to trick you into using a different format. Our <em>Architecture</em> manual details exactly how we link to the Debian repositories to ensure what you see is what you get.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion: Return to the Source</h2>
			<p>The "Snap Trap" is a symptom of a larger problem: Corporate Linux is trying to become macOS. It wants to manage you, instead of being managed <em>by</em> you. Tebian is the return to the source. We take the power of Debian and remove the corporate gatekeepers. No snaps. No forced updates. No traps. One ISO. One menu. Pure Debian.</p>
