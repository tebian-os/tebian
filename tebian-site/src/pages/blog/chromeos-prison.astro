			<h1>The ChromeOS Prison: Why your 'Cloud Laptop' is a lobotomized machine</h1>

		<article class="content">
			<p class="lead">Google marketed the Chromebook as the "Simple, Secure, and Affordable" computer for everyone. In reality, ChromeOS is a cage. It takes perfectly functional x86 and Arm hardware and lobotomizes it, turning a general-purpose computer into a glorified web browser. It is time to break out of the prison.</p>

			<h2>1. The Myth of "Cloud Speed"</h2>
			<p>Google claims that ChromeOS is fast because it "runs in the cloud." This is a technical lie. The speed of a Chromebook is limited by its local hardware—usually a low-power Intel Celeron or an Arm SoC. ChromeOS feels "fast" because it restricts you from running anything other than a browser. The moment you try to do real work—video editing, compiling code, or local AI—the OS blocks you.</p>
			
			<p>Tebian respects the silicon. We don't restrict your hardware to a single application. Our <strong>C-level foundation</strong> allows you to run a full Linux workstation on the exact same hardware that ChromeOS struggles to run three tabs on. By removing the Google telemetry and the heavy "Chrome Shell," we give the CPU back to the user.</p>

			<h2>2. The Data Harvest: Why it's "Free"</h2>
			<p>Chromebooks are cheap because the user is the product. Every keystroke, every search, and every file you "Sync to Drive" is data for Google's advertising engine. ChromeOS is not an operating system; it is a persistent surveillance node in your home or classroom. It is the antithesis of <strong>Digital Sovereignty.</strong></p>
			
			<p>Tebian is <strong>Silent.</strong> We have zero telemetry. We don't have a "Google Account" requirement. Your files stay on your disk. Your search stays in your head. When you switch a Chromebook to Tebian, you are performing a "Privacy Exorcism" on your hardware.</p>

			<h2>3. The Technical Lobotomy: Verified Boot</h2>
			<p>ChromeOS uses a feature called "Verified Boot" to prevent you from installing a different OS. They frame this as "Security," but it is actually "Ownership Control." It is a digital lock that prevents you from truly owning the machine you paid for. Breaking this lock (via Developer Mode or custom firmware) is the first step toward freedom.</p>
			
			<p>Once the lock is broken, Tebian's <strong>Universal Installer</strong> can take over. We provide specialized kernels for Chromebook hardware (handling the unique audio chips and touchpads that standard Linux distros miss). We turn that "lobotomized" machine into a <strong>Sovereign Node.</strong></p>

			<h2>Conclusion: Reclaiming the Machine</h2>
			<p>Your Chromebook is a computer, not a terminal for Google's servers. By installing Tebian, you are restoring its ability to think, create, and protect your privacy. You are moving from a "Tenant" of Google to the "Root" of your own machine. One ISO. One menu. Total reclamation.</p>
