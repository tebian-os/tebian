			<p class="lead">The era of the "Gaming PC" as a Windows-only box is over. Between the "Enshitification" of Windows 11 and the rise of the Steam Deck, the high-performance enthusiast has found a new home. Tebian transforms your hardware from a cluttered PC into a high-performance **Gaming Console.**</p>

			<h2>1. The Windows Performance Tax</h2>
			<p>If you are a gamer on Windows 11, you are fighting your own OS for resources. Every frame you render is competing with background telemetry, indexers, and Edge "Start-up Boost" services. This results in <strong>Micro-stutter</strong>—those tiny, sub-millisecond pauses that ruin the feel of a fast-paced shooter.</p>
			
			<p>Tebian's "Gaming Mode" uses a C-based daemon called <strong>GameMode.</strong> It performs a surgical strike on the Linux kernel: it locks your CPU into its highest performance state, grants the game process real-time priority, and suspends all non-essential background threads. The result is a "Flat" frame-time graph that Windows cannot match.</p>

			<h2>2. SteamOS vs. Tebian: The Stability War</h2>
			<p>Valve proved Linux is the best gaming platform with SteamOS. But SteamOS is built on **Arch Linux**, a rolling release that is prone to breakage. Tebian takes the SteamOS philosophy—the minimal UI, the Gamescope compositor, the Proton translation layer—and puts it on the <strong>Rock of Debian Stable.</strong> You get the console-like experience, but with the reliability of a server.</p>

			<h2>3. The Death of the Launcher</h2>
			<p>Windows gaming is a mess of fragmented launchers: Steam, Epic, GOG, Ubisoft, EA. Each one is a resource-hungry web-app that sits in your system tray. Tebian uses <strong>Heroic and Lutris</strong> to unify these platforms. You manage all your games through a single, C-based interface (Fuzzel). When you launch a game, it launches directly. No waiting for a launcher to "Sync to Cloud."</p>

			<h2>Conclusion: The Ultimate Console</h2>
			<p>The "Death of the Gaming PC" is really the <strong>Birth of the Gaming Rig.</strong> By stripping away the bloat of a general-purpose corporate OS, we turn your hardware into a dedicated machine for play. It is faster, more stable, and entirely yours. One ISO. One menu. Native speed. This is the end of the Windows monopoly.</p>
