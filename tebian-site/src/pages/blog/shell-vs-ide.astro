			<p class="lead">Most modern developers spend their day inside an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). They believe that features like "Auto-complete," "Debugger integration," and "Project management" require a massive, multi-gigabyte software suite. In Tebian, we believe this is a mistake. An IDE is a framework that restricts you; the shell is an engine that empowers you.</p>

			<h2>1. The Chromium Hijack</h2>
			<p>Modern IDEs like VSCode are not native applications. They are Electron apps—instances of the Chromium browser running a set of JavaScript scripts. This means that to edit a text file, you are loading a web browser engine that consumes 1GB+ of RAM. This is **Engineering Bloat.**</p>
			
			<p>In Tebian, your editor is <strong>Neovim.</strong> Written in C and configured in Lua, it treated your code as a high-performance data stream decades before Electron existed. It starts in milliseconds. It talks directly to the terminal's GPU buffer. It doesn't "Interpret" your UI; it "Executes" it.</p>

			<h2>2. The Unix Pipeline as a Workflow</h2>
			<p>When you use an IDE, you are limited by the buttons the developer provided. If you want to perform a complex search-and-replace across 1,000 files, you wait for an extension to do it. In the shell, you use <strong>Sed and Ag.</strong> You compose a pipeline that performs the work at the speed of your SSD's I/O. You aren't using a tool; you are building a tool on the fly.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion: Return to the Metal</h2>
			<p>Engineering is about efficiency. By choosing the shell over the IDE, you are reclaiming your CPU cycles and your cognitive bandwidth. One ISO. One menu. One shell. Total mastery.</p>
