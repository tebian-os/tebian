			<section class="overview">
				<h2>The Foundation of Predictability</h2>
				<p>In software engineering, the <strong>ABI (Application Binary Interface)</strong> is the contract between a program and the operating system. If the ABI changes, the program breaks. Most operating systems (Windows, Fedora, Arch) treat this contract as a "suggestion." They change libraries frequently, forcing developers to constantly recompile or "fix" their software. Tebian, via <strong>Debian Stable</strong>, treats the ABI as a sacred law.</p>
				
				<p>This manual provides the technical deep-dive into why binary stability is the most important feature of a professional workstation.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="sacred-contract">
				<h2>1. The Sacred Contract: Debian Stable</h2>
				<p>When a new version of Debian (like 12 or 13) is released, the versions of core libraries—<code>glibc</code>, <code>openssl</code>, <code>libstdc++</code>—are frozen. For the next 2-5 years, these versions will not change. Security patches are "back-ported," meaning the bug is fixed without changing the library's version number or internal structure.</p>
				
				<h3>Why this beats Windows</h3>
				<p>Windows attempts to maintain stability through <strong>DLL Hell.</strong> It keeps multiple versions of the same library on your disk, leading to bloat and confusion. When an app needs a specific DLL, Windows has to search through various folders to find it. Tebian uses a single, frozen version of the library that <em>every</em> app can rely on. This results in a leaner system and faster app startup times.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="production-reliability">
				<h2>2. Production Reliability: CI/CD and Tebian</h2>
				<p>For developers, Tebian's binary stability is a competitive advantage. If your code compiles on your Tebian workstation, it will run exactly the same way on your Debian-based production server. There is zero "Environment Drift."</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Consistent Toolchains:</strong> Your compiler (GCC/Clang) version stays the same for the entire project lifecycle.</li>
					<li><strong>Immutable Workflows:</strong> Scripts written for system automation in 2024 will work in 2026 without modification.</li>
					<li><strong>Stateless Containers:</strong> Tebian is the perfect host for Podman/Docker because the host kernel and container interface never move.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section class="user-experience">
				<h2>3. The User Experience of Stability</h2>
				<p>For the non-technical user, binary stability means <strong>Predictability.</strong> You don't wake up to find your printer driver stopped working or your browser extensions are broken. Tebian doesn't "change for the sake of change." It only changes when you decide it's time for a major version upgrade.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="conclusion">
				<h2>Conclusion: The Only Distro that Doesn't Break</h2>
				<p>The Binary Stability Manual proves that "Stable" doesn't mean "Old"—it means <strong>Reliable.</strong> By choosing Tebian, you are choosing an OS that respects your time and your work. You are opting out of the "Update and Pray" cycle. One ISO. One menu. Total stability. The way computing should be.</p>
